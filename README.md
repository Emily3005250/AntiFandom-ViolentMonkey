ViolentMonkey script to automatically redirect to alternative non-fandom hosted wikis.

If several choices are available (as is the case with elden ring and hollow knight), it gives you the choice towards which one you'd like to go.

If no alternatives are found it redirects to the antifandom.com version which is purified of all fandom bloat.

Currently supported alternative wiki domains are:
- Wiki.gg
- Fextralife.com
- wiki."GameName".com
- "Gamename".wiki

Manual overrides are accounted for:
- tolkiengateway.net as an alternative to lotr.fandom.com
- hearthstone.wiki.gg as an alternative to hearthstone-archive.fandom.com (the regular hearthstone.fandom.com already redirects to the wiki.gg as part of the core logic)
